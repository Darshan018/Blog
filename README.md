# What is DevOps ? Brief overview of Kubernetes and Docker.
In this article we will understand what devops is and what exactly kubernetes and docker do to
simplify the software development process.

# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of software development practices that aim to shorten the time between
software development and deployment. The term was first coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois.
The main goal of DevOps is to automate and streamline the software development process. In
order to do this, DevOps practitioners use a variety of tools and technologies. Some of the most
popular DevOps tools include Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, terraform, etc.
DevOps is becoming increasingly popular, as it can help organizations to speed up the software
development process and improve the quality of their software products. In addition, DevOps
can also help to reduce the risks associated with software development.

# Brief Overiew of Docker

Docker is a tool that helps developers to create and deploy applications.Docker automates the
deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run
virtually anywhere.
A Docker container shares the same operating system as the application it contains, as well as
its own libraries and other dependencies. Docker containers are easy to create, ship and run
because they don't rely on a pre-existing installation of software on the host machine or
additional libraries in the host environment.
Docker containers are built from images - lightweight read only templates with all of the
necessary parts to run an application: OS, language runtime, system tools and libraries. Images
can be created in a development environment then shipped to production ready for execution by
copying them onto servers or using them directly from public registries such as Docker Hub.

# Brief Overiew of Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source software that is used to orchestrate containers. It helps in solving
the problem of how to deploy and manage containerized applications across a cluster of hosts,
providing container-centric infrastructure. Kubernetes makes use of the Docker engine and it
was originally designed by Google, but now it is governed by the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation.
Kubernetes takes care of scaling up and down the number of containers that are running on a
host machine. It also handles all the services required for container orchestration like storage,
networking, deployment, replication etc. Kubernetes has many use cases such as continuous
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), load balancing, disaster recovery etc.
